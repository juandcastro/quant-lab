# Quant Lab

**AI/ML experiments for stock screening, anomaly detection, and quant signal generation — inspired by O'Neil, Weinstein, Minervini techniques, and deep learning.**

This project is an evolving research and engineering sandbox where I explore algorithmic trading ideas, machine learning models, and signal processing techniques for modern stock market analysis.

## 🔬 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to prototype, test, and share innovative AI-powered approaches for:
- Stock screening using fundamentals and technicals
- Momentum and trend stage detection (e.g., Stan Weinstein Stage Analysis)
- Quantitative filtering aligned with the CAN SLIM method
- Anomaly detection for early entry points
- Deep learning ranking models and signal generators

It blends classical strategies with cutting-edge ML.

## ⚙️ Current Work in Progress

This repo is actively evolving. I'm currently organizing and sharing code from past experiments (including my **Quant Project** used during the U.S. Investing Championship), and building new modules with:

- 📊 Custom stock sorter combining O'Neil + Weinstein + Minervini rules
- 🧠 Feature engineering and signal scoring with ML
- 📈 Exploratory notebooks and visual dashboards

🚧 **Expect ongoing commits and improvements. I’ll be sharing what I have progressively.**

## 🧠 Background & Vision

This project is a personal R&D initiative rooted in my competitive trading strategies and long-term vision to build intelligent financial systems. It complements my core professional focus on AI/ML for RF and microwave engineering.

Eventually, the most effective tools and models here may evolve into:
- Real-time signal APIs
- Dashboard-based trading assistants
- Proprietary trading system backends
